Merrrrry Christmas you guys! It's ya boi, Oliver_Hart, here to deliver your Christmas Present. I've got a little something special for you all: an alpha version of my latest project, a piece of interactive fiction/CYOA called “A Red Winter”.

A Red Winter features two waifurs, audio and visual elements, multiple story paths (in the spirit of visual novels), lewdness and multiple endings. It's hosted online and is playable for free. I'm also working on getting some character art!

Please note that this adventure is NOT finished. This is a prototype/alpha build, and more of a “here’s what i’ve working on” than anything else. I cannot promise that the game and the itch platform are bug/error free, as this is my first time using itch, and there was a lot of text for me to edit

Without any further ramblings, let’s start this bitch

Summary: A Red Winter is a choose-your-own-adventure story about Hunter Gibbs, an aspiring ranger who arrives at North Station with one goal in mind: find work and walk away rich. But when he meets Summer the corgi and June the reindeer, he learns the town is up to its knees in drugs and violence. Can he save North Station, or will he let it rot?
